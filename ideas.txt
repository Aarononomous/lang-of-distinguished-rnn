* What language is a word/sentence in?
    - samples?
    - http://www.uow.edu.au/~dlee/corpora2.htm
    - it looks like a lot of work to consolidate this data
    - the interesting thing would be minimizing the number of hidden nodes

* Number of dots in an image. Could this be log-order to simplify?
    - is there a way to use Matlab to easily generate these images?
    - what about easily counting the dots in MATLAB?
    - slight overlaps?
    - ConvNet?
    - difference btw number and total coverage

* Predict tomorrow's weather, based on today's current conditions.
    - where to get datasets? http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets

* Very small neural nets to calculate very simple, but -- importantly -- non-linear, functions on very small inputs.
    - e.g.: Union all, Intersect all, reverse the order of input, number "on," sum, average, highest, lowest, etc.
    - the point of this would be to examine the structures (formulae) created by the trained NN i.r.t. linear but mostly non-linear and logical operators. Also, try to reduce the number of hidden nodes.

* Correct moves to solve Tower of Hanoi.
    - how to handle illegal moves? Maybe it doesn't matter?
    - how to handle finishing

* Legal chess move, given the board. White to move.

* Some other dataset

* Count the number of colors in an image
    - only interesting if the structure of the image is taken into account, e.g. shading over an object, cast shadows
