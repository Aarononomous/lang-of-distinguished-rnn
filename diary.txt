Pre-processing

1. scraped everything and saved it to lang.txt
2. went through each one
    - each word on its own line
    - removed any obvious punctuation, numbers, etc.
    - if it was non-Latin, removed Latin (usually English) words
        - or replaced individual letters with the Cyrillic/Greek equiv.
        - Welsh is still fucked up -- something about the dipthongs
